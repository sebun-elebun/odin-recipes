    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti is one of those dishes that can be eaten on daily basis and yet it's very hard to get bored with.</p>
    <p>Like other types of pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water. Unlike some other types of pasta, it is exclusively made from wheat called semolina giving it i.a. characteristical yellow colour and falvour.</p>
    <p>Speaking of flavour, spaghetti carbonara has plenty of it. Fresh pasta, eggs, hard cheese, pork, pepper. So few ingredients, so much flavour!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>Room temperature eggs</li>
        <li>Pancetta</li>
        <li>Pecorino</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil spaghetti and fry pancetta</li>
        <li>Combine boiled spaghetti and fried pancetta with mixture of beaten eggs and grated pecorino</li>
        <li>Add water the pasta was cooked in to adjust consistency of the sauce making it creamy</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
